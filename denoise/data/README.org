* DREAM data
Data for the DREAM disease module identification challenge is located 
under the dream_files/ directory.

** DREAM Networks
The files labeled dream_N.txt in this folder are the 6 deanonymized
networks from the DREAM disease module identification challenge. Each
row in the file represents one edge in the network. The format for a
row is GENE1 GENE2 CONFIDENCE. That is, it can be viewed as an
edgelist.

** GO Labels
The file labeled human.golabels is a map from GO labels to proteins.
Each row of the file is of the form GO_LABEL P1 ... PN and represents
one entry in the map.

The GO labels are pulled from the most recent (as of Friday, April
24, 2020) version of the human GO annotations and GO ontology. They
are constructed from all three branches of the GO ontology (Molecular,
Cellular, Biological) where annotations at the root are removed
because they are too general. GO annotations are further pruned if
they annotate less than 100 or more than 1000 proteins.
